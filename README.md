# The Martha Toolbox
Our ocean is in crisis, due to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, pollution, coastal development, and climate change.
Conservation practitioners on the other hand have to struggle with limited resources, such as funding, time, and personnel.
They need to prioritize locations, configurations, and actions to support conservation. Therefore, in conservation planning and management, spatial prioritization become important.

The problem is, spatial prioritization is exhaustive and time consuming. There are three stages required, the first one is providing input files, which include conservation targets, threats, costs, and constraint. This step alone require 60% of the time. The second one is analysis using software. Since softwares such as MARXAN, ZONATION, CLUZ, and PRIORITIZR exist, this step is usually very straight forward and only requires around 10% of the time. The most important step is step 3, discussing output. This step include result interpretation and discussion with target audience. While it is the most important step to get stakeholder agreement and support, this step usually only get allocation of 30% of the total time.

Therefore, we propose The MARTHA Toolbox. Marine Spatial Prioritization and Habitat Analysis Toolbox. Help to provide input files for marine spatial prioritization using available data and information from the cloud and machine learning. Cloud based tools, no downloads, no install. Focus on conservation by providing input files for marine spatial prioritization using available data and information. Saves time and resources since integrated data source and scientific workflows are pre-built in the toolbox.

This toolbox is for Conservation practitioners and people interested in conservation, such as researchers, cartographers, and investors in conservation.
Anyone working with community based conservation efforts. The methodology can also be applied for spatial planners, development organizations, private sectors, and many others.

The toolbox includes Cloud based GIS and remote sensing tools to provide input for systematic conservation planning. Step by step wizard to implement spatial prioritization as a part of systematic conservation planning. Community support, customer support, and possibility to be integrated to existing conservation projects. Prebuilt algorithm. Proven scientific workflows will be coded within the toolbox, hence automating most of the process. Resources which include Examples, templates, and technical guides for users to get started or enhance existing spatial plan.
